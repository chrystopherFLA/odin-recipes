        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Ravioli is an Italian dumpling that's typically stuffed with ricotta, meat, cheese, and vegetables. The filling is then sealed between two thin layers of egg pasta dough and typically served with a delicious tomato or cream-based pasta sauce.</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>


        -Ravioli Dough
        <ul>
              
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>1 ½ tablespoons water</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon olive oil</li>
            <li>  -Ravioli Filling</li>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) container ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>1 (4 ounce) package cream cheese, softened</li>
            <li>½ cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>½ cup shredded provolone cheese</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons dried parsley</li>

        </ul>
              -Pesto-Alfredo Cream sauce
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons prepared basil pesto sauce</li>
            <li>2 cups heavy cream</li>
            <li>¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>1 (24 ounce) jar marinara sauce</li>
        </ul>

            -Egg Wash
        <ul>    
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon water</li>
        </ul>



        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Mound the flour and salt together on a work surface and form a well. Beat 2 eggs, water, and olive oil in a bowl. Pour half the egg mixture into the well. Begin mixing the egg with the flour with one hand; use your other hand to keep the flour mound steady. Add the remaining egg mixture and knead to form a dough.</li>
            <li>Knead the dough until smooth, 8 to 10 minutes; add more flour if the dough is too sticky. Form dough into a ball and wrap tightly with plastic. Refrigerate for 1 hour.</li>
            <li>While the dough is resting, prepare the ravioli filling. Mix ricotta cheese, cream cheese, mozzarella cheese, egg, and parsley until well combined. Set the filling aside.</li>
            <li>Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add crushed garlic and pesto sauce and cook for one minute. Stir in heavy cream, increase the heat to high, and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 5 minutes. Stir in Parmesan cheese until melted. Remove the pan from the heat and keep warm.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, in a separate saucepan, warm the marinara sauce over medium-low heat.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Beat the egg with the tablespoon of water to make the egg wash.</li>
            <li>Roll out the pasta dough into thin sheets no thicker than a nickel. To assemble the ravioli, brush the egg wash over a sheet of pasta. Drop cheese filling in 1-teaspoon portions onto the dough, 1-inch apart.</li>
            <li>Cover the filling with the top sheet of pasta; use your fingers to press around each portion of filling, making the seal as airtight as possible. Cut out individual ravioli with a knife or pizza cutter. Use your fingers to seal the edges.</li>
            <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Stir in the ravioli and return to a boil. Cook uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the ravioli float to the top and the filling is hot, 4 to 8 minutes. Drain well.</li>
            <li>Grease a baking sheet. Place the cooked ravioli on the baking sheet and bake in the preheated oven until brown, about 4 minutes.</li>
            <li>To serve, divide ravioli between four warmed serving bowls. Drizzle marinara sauce on top, followed by cream sauce.</li>
